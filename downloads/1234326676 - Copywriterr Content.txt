Email subscriptions are a vital way for most businesses to stay connected with their customers. But there's a lot of noise in the world — email from spammy or misleading sources can easily be outnumbered by good updates from the companies you actually want to support. 

To start off, make sure you follow up on subscribers whose contacts you haven't reached in a while. You can also set up autoresponders in Gmail to automatically reply to subscribers who request it.

Secondly, segment your list. This means looking at past emails you've received and how often they pertain to the topic of your current email. For example, if you regularly receive updates about coupons and discounts, try sending periodic emails with deals and incentives. Emails that are personalized and that relate to your brand or profession will have a higher chance of being opened.

Last but not least, personalize your emails. It gets more open rates than any other form of communication. Whether it’s building an email list or encouraging people to take action on your website, personalized email feels special, and directly addressed, and hence can convert more than any other form of digital communication. And, while web users prefer receiving marketing emails with a subject line that sets them up for action, email providers can optimize their email lists by including captions or other information that draws in the reader.
