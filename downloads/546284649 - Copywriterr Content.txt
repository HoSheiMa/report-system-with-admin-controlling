Vitamin D is a major hormone that your body needs to regulate your body temperature. It has recently been discovered to affect mood and memory in a positive way, which puts it on the fast track to becoming one of the best supplements you can take. It gives us the ability to run faster, feel happier, stay conscious longer, fight cancer, etc.

It is an orange-colored crystal that's made up of sunshine and ultraviolet rays from the sun. Many of us are deficient in this crucial nutrient, however, and some experts are beginning to say that too much sunlight can be a problem as well. That's why the American Heart Association recommends that adults get 25% of their daily vitamin D from sunlight, and most local stores will let you buy supplements that give you 400 international units (IU) per day.

To feel the benefits of Vitamin D, you need to have a blood Vitamin D level of 55 ng/mL or more. This level is believed to protect against some serious diseases. In addition to feeling healthier, those with higher Vitamin D levels may have a firmer immune system and lower risks of some types of cancer. In terms of skin care, those with darker skin need to have their skin exposed to the sun fewer times per week for an easier conversion that ultimately results in using less peeling and chemical-based products.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps produce the pigment collagen. Collagen supports normal, healthy functioning of the body's connective tissues and helps to maintain normal bone density. It also helps hair grow in a regular fashion. If youâ€™re asking yourself whether or not to take a vitamin D3 supplement, read on to learn more about this powerful sun-protectant.
