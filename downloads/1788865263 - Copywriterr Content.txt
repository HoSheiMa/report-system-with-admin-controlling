First, choose a spot where the chicken will not get up before you. (If it were me, I'd start in the waiting area and work my way down.) Then, lay a tight circle of foil around the bird. (So if the chicken hops up and down, it's not getting pinched.) Trips may begin and end in different spots, so it's a good idea to have a backup plan. Next, with one hand on the chicken's neck and the other supporting its wings, roll slowly but firmly so that the bird does not tumble. That's it! The process may take a few minutes, but the payoff is exhilarating — and delicious The key here is to use light, careful pressure — not too much, not too little — as you position your hand over the animal's neck.
