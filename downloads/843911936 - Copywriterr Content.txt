-----------------------------------------------------

Copywriterr Content: 

A toilet can be used by any member of the cat family whether it be a feline, a canine, or a marsupial. Opinions may differ as to whether a particular species can use a particular type of toilet or not whether the same species can use doors, windows, and even plumbing. Some people believe that all felines can use a toilet although others will claim that certain breeds (such as Rottweilers) are incapable of using fixtures for bathing or excreting matter.

Although adorable, oftentimes cats can be messy and their disposal procedures gross. As such, teaching them the proper way to use the bathroom can be a hassle. This is where a litter box and bowl come in very handy. The truth is, you don’t really need a fancy trick to get your cat to use the toilet. Just like you can train a dog to go to the door, speak directly to their emotions and aim for the most positive response. Once they are using the toilet consistently and in gesture mode, take them outside and reward them. This will develop their trust in you as a pet owner, and when they taste success they will be more inclined to use the bathroom again and again.

The whole process of teaching your cat how to use the toilet is not only fun but can also help you save money on litter costs over time. If your cat dozes off in the evening and doesn’t get up, you might not be able to cuddle him the next morning. Teaching your cat how to use the litter box will also help you build a stronger bond between you and your pet.
