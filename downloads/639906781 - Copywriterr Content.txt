The open rate is the percentage of people who try to open an email sent to them by a business or an organization. This number can be used to determine how important email is to your brand or business. While a large number of businesses and organizations send email, not all open emails are valuable. The most valuable emails are the ones that convert or persuade prospect into buying something. The best open rates for a business or organization are based on analyzing data from other email campaigns.

It’s a key metric in email marketing, as it’s an indicator of how likely your recipients are to read your email and act on it. For example, let’s say you have a 1% open rate on your marketing emails. That means if 1 out of every 10 emails you send are never opened, you have a 0% chance of actually sending someone valuable information. If instead you had a 30% open rate, that means you could double the value of those emails by opening them 20 times!

Email opens are a click statistic in the spam filter and kill most marketing strategies. Still, they're worth knowing, especially if you run a small business or are writing an email for someone else. Email opens can help you figure out whether your content is converting visitors into customers who actually buy your products or services. A solid majority of people who responded to my surveys online replied that they read more and took action after receiving an email with a product or promotion.
