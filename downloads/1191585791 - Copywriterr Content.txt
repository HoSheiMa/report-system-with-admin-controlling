Recent statistics show that barking dogs in the neighborhood can be as disruptive as loud music. In addition to disrupting sleep and leading to arguments with family and friends, dogs can pose an imminent physical threat to people in the neighborhood. 

Dogs bark at night because they are looking for familiar territory. When you ignore their calls, they get angrier until they bite or scratch at your property. If you call the police, they may be less likely to believe that your dog is barking at night because it is genuinely excited to see you, not because it is looking for an excuse to attack. If you want to prevent your dog from becoming a nuisance in your home, it is essential that you understand how to tell if your dog is excited about seeing you. 

At the end of the day, dogs are wonderful family members. They help reduce loneliness and stress as well as provide some much-needed company. However, they do need to be kept safely out of your bedroom and during the times that you are at home most of the day. Whether it's because you're at work or going to bed early, there will always be distractions waiting for you in the house. Make sure you give your dog space and quiet during these times so that she feels safe and knows where she should go.
