Email marketing is an effective way to reach people and keep them engaged. It can help you build a relationship by bringing you into their social networks, get them to subscribe to your blog, and help you build a list of people to send offers to. The tactics you use in email marketing will depend on what kind of campaign you're running, but the basic idea is that you send an email to someone with a certain offer or teaser onto their page (such as a website, ad, etc.). Either way though, once they see it, they are likely to act on it and take some sort of action toward that offer or teaser.

Today, undoubtedly, email marketing has become one of the most powerful forms of digital marketing. It is cheap, time-saving and can draw a large number of potential customers for products and services you offer. Besides the convenience factor, email marketing not only provides you with an opportunity to stay connected with your customers but also helps you establish contact with them in order to handle problems and make sales.

However, just like there are disadvantages to everything, email marketing is no less. You have to handle your email address privately, and most of the times you are going to require a paid SMTP server. There are limitations too to the number of emails that can be sent per day and per month, so if you are going to use this method, get ready to set a reasonable budget. Regardless, the best part is that you can track results and grow a list through email marketing. While it may not be as actionable as visits to a store or receiving product recommendations on the phone, email marketing can produce results. It can save you time and money by guiding your customers through the sales process.
