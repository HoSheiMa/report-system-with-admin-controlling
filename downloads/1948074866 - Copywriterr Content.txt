While you may be tempted to cut out fast-food restaurants and fast-paced lives in general, it's more than likely that these types of habits will contribute to your weight gain. A study found that consuming fruits and vegetables is a simple way to control weight and prevent obesity. These foods contain fiber which assists with digestion, makes you feel fuller for longer, and can even lower cholesterol levels in those who already have disease.

Eating fiber may be the most effective way to lose weight without exercising. It's been scientifically proven to shift your body's metabolic process towards fat loss instead of muscle building. Once you start eating fiber, your body will start breaking down stored fat for energy instead of storing muscle. You'll feel fuller for longer than if you ate plain food. Some people who tried this diet reported feeling full for up to 12 hours after eating plain food.

Regardless, a small amount of exercise every day can have a big impact on your weight. And no, that does not mean going to the gym, sweating yourself out, or deadlifting those heavy weights. Just one hour of brisk walking burns more calories than an average meal, and switching from sugary drinks to water or non-sugar sweetened drinks can also reduce your calorie intake by about 500 calories per day. Many a times, people who have eliminated sugar from their diet entirely have been able to maintain their weight without changing their diet in the long run.
